# Fraud Detection Using Machine Learning

## 📌 Project Overview
This project focuses on detecting fraudulent financial transactions using machine learning techniques.  
It was built as my **first end-to-end data science project** to understand real-world ML workflows.

---

## 📂 Dataset
- The dataset contains financial transaction records
- Features include transaction type, amount, and balance information
- Target variable indicates whether a transaction is **fraudulent or not**
- The dataset is highly **imbalanced**, which reflects real-world scenarios

---

## ⚙️ Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Imbalanced-learn (SMOTE)
- Matplotlib

---

## 🧠 Approach
1. Data exploration and preprocessing  
2. Handling missing values and encoding categorical features  
3. Addressing class imbalance using **SMOTE**  
4. Train-test split  
5. Model training using **Random Forest Classifier**  
6. Model evaluation using:
   - Precision
   - Recall
   - F1-score
   - Precision-Recall Curve

---

## 📊 Model Used
- Random Forest Classifier  
- Class weighting was applied to handle imbalance  

---

## ✅ Results
The model achieved good performance on imbalanced data by prioritizing **precision and recall**, which are crucial metrics in fraud detection problems.

---

## 🎯 Key Learnings
- Importance of handling imbalanced datasets
- Why accuracy is not suitable for fraud detection
- End-to-end machine learning pipeline implementation
- Practical use of evaluation metrics

---

## 🚀 Future Improvements
- Feature importance analysis
- Confusion matrix visualization
- Trying advanced models like XGBoost or LightGBM
- Hyperparameter tuning
